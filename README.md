# CoreKit

Ultimate cross platform framework to create appleOS apps.


### Warning: development in progress, here is a small todo list:

* CGPDFPage+DrawContext it's not really good inside CG
* Data+Json should be reviewed because of the new JSON parsing
* String+JsonMinified should be checked
* TimeZoneLocation + Sun should be rewritten from the ground (moon additions)
* Timer+block
* Server + Request + Response complete refactor?!?
* SKCircularProgressView not working on macOS (check uibezierpath)
* AppleImage+Vector is not supported currently on macOS
* AppleImage+Effects is not supported currently on macOS
* AppleViewController+Alert check & move extension to AppleAlertControllerAlert
* AppleViewController extensions are iOS + tvOS only right now
* AppleFont+Family available fonts can be refactored with the 2 functions above... flatMap ftw!
* Explicit scrollView delegate for CollectionView
* Fix collection views headers / footers for macOS
* Better cross platform UI/App-Kit typealiases (label, etc.)
* Write more tests
* Write proper docs

Enjoy. ;)
